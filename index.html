        <p>
          Happy birthday, broo! Just wanted to drop you a little card to say how stoked I am for you on turning 26. You've accomplished so much in your life already, and it's seriously impressive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your dedication, hard work, and never-give-up attitude are seriously badass. You've always been brave and determined, and I know you'll keep crushing it in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just remember, I've got your back no matter what. I'm always here to celebrate your wins and support you through the tough times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wishing you a year filled with joy, love, and success, Go out and make the most of your day.
